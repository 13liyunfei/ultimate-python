# Ultimate Python study guide

Ultimate Python study guide, influenced by [ultimate-go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go).

## Goals

Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

**Serve as a resource** for newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This
repository has a collection of Python files which can be run in an IDE or a
terminal. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader
through what the programs are doing step-by-step.

**Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts.
Only builtin libraries are leveraged so that concepts can be conveyed without
the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries
and frameworks (i.e. `sqlalchemy`, `requests`, `pandas`) are not installed.

## Table of contents

- **Language Mechanics**
    - Variable: [Built-in literals](ultimatepython/variable.py)
    - Expression: [Numeric operations](ultimatepython/expression.py)
    - Conditional: [if | if-else | if-elif-else](ultimatepython/conditional.py)

## Additional resources

Going through the content above will give you, the reader, a solid
understanding of core Python fundamentals.

As you start applying Python fundamentals to the real world,
consider reading over best practices and examples in other
well-regarded resources.

Here are some repositories to get you started:

- [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)
- [faif/python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)
- [geekcomputers/Python](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python)
