# Ultimate Python study guide

Ultimate Python study guide, influenced by [ultimate-go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go).

## Goals

Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

**Serve as a resource** for Python newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on.
This repository has a collection of standalone modules which can be run
in an IDE or a terminal. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which
guide a reader through what the programs are doing step-by-step.

**Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts.
Only builtin libraries are leveraged so that these concepts can be conveyed without
the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries
and frameworks (i.e. `sqlalchemy`, `requests`, `pandas`) are not installed.

read over best practices and examples from other well-regarded
resources.
