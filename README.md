# Ultimate Python study guide

Ultimate Python study guide, influenced by [ultimate-go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go).

## Goals

Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

**Serve as a resource** for newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This
repository has a collection of Python files which can be run in an IDE or a
terminal. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader
through what the programs are doing step-by-step.

**Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts.
As such, only builtin libraries are leveraged; popular open-source libraries
and frameworks (i.e. `sqlalchemy`, `requests`, `pandas`) are not installed.

## Table Of Contents

- **Language Mechanics**
    - Variable: [Built-in types](ultimatepython/variable.py)
    - Expression: [Numeric operations](ultimatepython/expression.py)
